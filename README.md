# Fair Online Advertising

This repository contains the code used for the simulations in the paper [Fair Online Advertising](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10450).

To run the simulations,
1. Place the Yahoo A1 data-set (`ydata-ysm-advertiser-bids-v1_0.txt`) in the `Webscope_A1` folder. The dataset is available at [Webscope: Datasets](https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=a).
2. Update python installation and number of cores in `run.sh`.
